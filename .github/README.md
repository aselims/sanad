# GitHub CI/CD Deployment for Development

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment to the dev.sanad.selimsalman.de development server.

## Required Secrets

For the development environment, we've minimized the required secrets to just:

1. `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The SSH private key for deployment user with access to the server
2. `DEPLOY_USER`: The SSH username on the deployment server

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions" in the left sidebar
4. Click on "New repository secret" to add each secret

## SSH Key Generation (if needed)

If you need to generate a new SSH key for deployment:

```bash
# Generate a key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-deploy-key"

# Copy the public key to the server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@selimsalman.de

# Copy the private key to add as a GitHub secret
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Make sure the user has appropriate permissions on the server.

## Server Setup

The development server needs to have:

1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. A directory at `/var/www/dev.sanad.selimsalman.de` (or change DEPLOY_PATH in the workflow)
3. Proper domain configuration for dev.sanad.selimsalman.de

## Development Workflow

The deployment is triggered when code is pushed to the `develop` branch. The workflow:

1. Builds the frontend and prepares the backend
2. Deploys to the development server
3. Uses simplified configuration with non-sensitive default values
4. Runs the application in development mode using `dev.sh --local`
