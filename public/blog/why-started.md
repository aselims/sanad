## **Why I Introduced Ta'awanu (or Sanad): A Platform for Meaningful Collaboration**  

The explosion of Generative AI has made it easier than ever to build applications, access information, and launch initiatives. The barriers to entry are lower, but paradoxically, this has not necessarily led to better outcomes. Instead, we see an overwhelming number of startups, products, and initiatives—many of which solve the same problems in slightly different ways. The ecosystem is scattered, making it difficult for promising innovations to rise above the noise.  

This is where *Ta'awanu* (or *Sanad*) comes in. The idea is simple but crucial: **collaboration is always a good thing, and we need more of it.** Why waste resources reinventing the wheel when teams could be working together, combining their strengths, and building on top of each other's expertise?  

### **The Paradox of Abundance**  
AI has ushered in an era of abundance, but **abundance must be channeled wisely.** What do we gain when there are 1,000 different apps that do the same thing, with minor variations in design or branding? Instead of improving outcomes, this often leads to wasted effort, duplicated work, and a fragmented ecosystem where truly valuable innovations struggle to gain visibility.  

The startup failure rate speaks for itself—**95% of startups fail.** Many of these failures happen not because the idea was bad, but because the right connections, resources, or partnerships were missing. What if, before failing, these startups had explored collaboration opportunities? What if they had found synergies with others working on similar problems?  

### **Collaboration is the Future**  
Even the biggest players in the industry recognize the power of collaboration. Look at how **Salesforce and Google joined forces**—despite being tech giants, they understood that working together would drive greater impact than competing in isolation. If industry leaders embrace collaboration, why shouldn’t startups, researchers, and individuals do the same?  

The purpose of *Ta'awanu* is to **facilitate meaningful connections**—between institutions, companies, startups, and individuals. Whether it's R&D partnerships, startup alliances, or talent-driven innovation, the platform encourages **mutual support and shared success** instead of isolated efforts that often lead to failure.  

### **A Call for Collective Progress**  
The name *Ta'awanu* is inspired by a profound principle:  
> *"وَتَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلۡبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقۡوَىٰۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَ ٰ⁠نِۚ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِیدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ"*  
> *"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression."* (Surah Al-Māʾidah: 2)  

This verse reminds us that collaboration, when guided by the right intentions, can lead to collective progress and a better future for all.  

### **Can We Build a Culture of Collaboration?**  
The real question is: **Can we move from a culture of fragmentation to a culture of collaboration?** Can we embrace the mindset that working together is not a weakness, but a strength? I believe we can, and *Ta'awanu* is my contribution to making that happen.  

Let’s build together, not apart. Let’s **collaborate before we fail.**
