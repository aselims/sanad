        This Cookie Policy explains how Saned uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our platform.
      </p>
      
      <h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      
      <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the platform to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our platform. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies enable the platform to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> These cookies may be set through our platform by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <p>
        We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them).
      </p>
      
      <h2>4. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the platform, deliver advertisements, and so on.
      </p>
      
      <h2>5. Controlling Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you.
      </p>
      
      <h2>6. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookie Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
