## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aselims/sanad.git
cd sanad
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Frontend
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

## Running the Application

### Development Environment
The development environment includes hot-reloading for both frontend and backend, and is configured for debugging.

#### Using dev.sh script (Recommended)

The project has been simplified to use only two modes:

```bash
# Start the development environment with local backend
./dev.sh --local

# Start the development environment with remote backend
./dev.sh --remote

# Seed the database with initial data
./dev.sh --local --seed-db
```

#### Docker Compose Files
We now use two specific docker-compose files based on the deployment mode:

1. `docker-compose.dev-local.yml`: For local development with all services running locally
2. `docker-compose.dev-remote.yml`: For development using a remote backend API

The simplified `dev.sh` script automatically uses the appropriate file based on your selected mode.

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: ./dev.sh [OPTIONS]
Options:
  --local              Run with local backend (default)
  --remote             Run with remote backend
  --seed-db            Seed the database with initial data
  --jwt-secret VALUE   Set JWT secret for authentication
  --openai-key VALUE   Set OpenAI API key
  --help               Show this help message
```

### Production Environment
The production environment is optimized for performance and security.

```bash
# Start the production environment
./prod.sh
# or
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This will:
- Start the PostgreSQL database (not exposed to host)
- Start the backend API server (not exposed to host)
- Start the frontend server on port 80 with Nginx

## Deployment Options

### Local Deployment
You can deploy the application locally using the provided scripts:
- `./dev.sh` for development
- `./prod.sh` for production

Simple usage: ./dev.sh --local or ./dev.sh --remote
No .env file editing required to switch modes
Custom remote URL support: ./dev.sh --remote https://custom-api.example.com
Help documentation built in: ./dev.sh --help
Clean state management: Creates/removes override files automatically
Explicit feedback showing which mode is active
Default behavior (local mode) when run without parameters
You can run it with:
./dev.sh (defaults to local)
./dev.sh --local (explicitly local)
./dev.sh --remote (uses default remote URL)
./dev.sh --remote https://custom-url.com (uses custom remote URL)
This eliminates any manual configuration steps while providing total flexibility.


## Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for configuration. For production, create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_DATABASE=sanad_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Project Structure
- `/frontend`: React frontend application
- `/backend`: Node.js Express backend API
- `/docs`: Project documentation
- `docker-compose.yml`: Development environment configuration
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Production environment configuration
- `dev.sh`: Script to start the development environment
- `prod.sh`: Script to start the production environment

## CI/CD Integration
The Docker setup is compatible with various CI/CD platforms:

### GitHub Actions
Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with:
```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build and push Docker images
      run: |
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
        # Add steps to push to your container registry and deploy
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running with `docker-compose ps`
- **Container startup failures**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs -f [service_name]`
- **Performance issues**: For production, ensure you're using `docker-compose.prod.yml` not the development configuration
- **Data persistence**: All data is stored in Docker volumes; back them up regularly

## Best Practices
- Keep environment variables secure and never commit them to version control
- Regularly update your Docker images to get security patches
- Back up your database volumes regularly
- Monitor your application's performance and logs
