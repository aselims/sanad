# Venture Studio Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2.0

## Executive Summary

Transform Collobi.com into a lean, focused venture studio platform using a systematic, AI-implementable approach. This PRD prioritizes features for rapid value delivery and systematic development by AI coding agents.

## Critical Analysis of Current Plan

### Issues with VSPlan.md v1:
- **Overwhelming scope**: 2,500+ lines attempting everything at once
- **AI-unfriendly structure**: Lacks atomic, implementable tasks
- **No MVP focus**: No clear path to early value delivery
- **Mixed priorities**: Critical features buried in complexity
- **Implementation gaps**: Missing concrete steps for AI agents

## Core Business Objectives

1. **Accelerate idea-to-venture pipeline** (3x faster than competitors)
2. **Increase success rate** (40%+ ventures reach Series A)
3. **Build network effects** (platform grows value with each user)
4. **Generate recurring revenue** (subscription + success fees)
5. **Create defensible moats** (data, network, expertise)

# AI IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

## Task Structure for AI Agents

### 1. Atomic Task Definition
Each task should be:
- **Specific**: Exactly what needs to be built
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria
- **Independent**: Can be completed in isolation
- **Estimable**: 4-40 hours of work

### 2. Implementation Order
1. **Database First**: Schema changes and migrations
2. **API Second**: Backend endpoints and business logic
3. **Frontend Third**: UI components and integration
4. **Testing Fourth**: Unit and integration tests

### 3. Quality Gates
- [ ] Schema migration runs successfully
- [ ] API endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Frontend components render correctly
- [ ] Tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Security review completed

## Development Standards

### Database Migrations
```typescript
// Example migration template
export const up = async (queryInterface: QueryInterface) => {
  await queryInterface.addColumn('ideas', 'businessModel', {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    allowNull: true
  });
  
  await queryInterface.addIndex('ideas', ['status', 'createdAt']);
};
```

### API Endpoint Template
```typescript
// Example endpoint implementation
router.post('/api/ideas', authenticate, validateIdeaInput, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const idea = await IdeaService.createIdea(req.user.id, req.body);
    res.status(201).json({ success: true, data: idea });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Component Template
```typescript
// Example React component structure
interface IdeaFormProps {
  initialData?: Partial<Idea>;
  onSubmit: (idea: IdeaFormData) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
}

export const IdeaForm: React.FC<IdeaFormProps> = ({ 
  initialData, 
  onSubmit, 
  onCancel 
}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

## Success Metrics & KPIs
